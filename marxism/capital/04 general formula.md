# 4. The general formula for capital

> The circulation of commodities is the starting-point of capital.

- historically, capital first appeared as money - merchants and userers had it
- practically, all new capital enters the stage as money
  - money that is capital vs money that is just money differ in circulation
  - the simplest form of the circulation of commodities is $C-M-C$
  - within this circulation, we can also find $M-C-M$ - this is where capital comes from
- the purpose is to make an $M-C-M'$ process, where $M' = M + \Delta M$, i.e. the original money plus some **surplus value**

> You gotta have money to make money.
