# 2. Exchange

- exchange happens when a commodity has no use value to the owner
  - 
- money is a natural outcome of commodity exchange
  - money is not arbitrarily chosen to have value, and thus bestows value upon everything else
  - something can be money because it has value
- puts chapter 1 into context
