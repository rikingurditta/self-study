# 3. Money, or the circulation of commodities

## 1. The measure of values

- gold is assumed as the money commodity
- [Liv Agar has some stuff to say about this]
  - Marx thought that getting off the gold standard would be impossible
- money does not enable exchange, it is the other way around
  - commodities are not commensurable for exchange because of money
  - "all commodities, as values, are realized human labour" - all commodities having value is what lets all of them be measured in money
- law is what defines units of money, e.g. how much is "one dollar" in gold

## 2. The medium of circulation

### a. The metamorphosis of commodities

> We saw in a former chapter that the exchange of commodities implies contradictory and mutually exclusive conditions. The differentiation of commodities into commodities and money does not sweep away these inconsistencies, but developes a modus vivendi, a form in which they can exist side by side. This is generally the way in which real contradictions are reconciled. For instance, it is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another, and as, at the same time, constantly flying away from it. The ellipse is a form of motion which, while allowing this contradiction to go on, at the same time reconciles it.

$$
\mathbf v' = -\frac{GM}{\lVert\mathbf r \rVert^2} \hat{\mathbf r}
$$

> The first metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly, not only the moneyâ€™s movement, but also that of the commodity itself; in the second metamorphosis, on the contrary, the movement appears to us as the movement of the money alone.

Question from Joyce: *Isn't there a movement of a commodity in the second metamorphosis, of $M-C$?*

- the original commodity does not move again
- the total effect is the exchange of commodities $C-C$, but the first commodity stops moving in the first half of the $C-M-C$ process, and only money moves after
