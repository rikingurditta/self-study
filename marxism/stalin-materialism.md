## Notes on the text

### Introduction

- dialectical materialism
  - dialectical method of studying nature
  - materialist conception of nature
- historical materialism is dialectical materialism applied to social life
- builds on Hegelian dialectics and Feuerbach's materialism, but is radically different to both

>  "My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, ... the process of thinking which, under the name of 'the Idea,' he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos (creator) of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of 'the Idea.' With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought."
> \- Marx, Afterword to the Second German Edition of Volume I of Capital

- dialectics sees nature as developing due to changes imposed by its own contradictions
  - the interaction of opposing forces
