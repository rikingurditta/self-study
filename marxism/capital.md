## Part one: Commodities and money

### I. Commodities

A **commodity** is an object that satisfies a want

> To discover the various uses of things is the work of history.

- **use-value** is how useful something is as an object
  - use-values cannot exist abstractly, they are limited by physical properties of commodities, so commodities *are* use-values in material form
  - use-value is independent of how much labour it takes to use it
    - (<u>I think</u> this means that e.g. the extensive process required to make Niqiu edible does not affect the use-value of Niqiu, the use-value of Niqiu is determined only by the fact that we want to eat it)
  - a use-value is only realized when the object is used or consumed
  - they are the "material depositories of exchange value"
- **exchange value** is "the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort"
  - commodities have many exchange values - one for each commodity they could be exchanged with
  - "exchange value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it"
- different commodities have use-values of different qualities, but their exchange values only differ in quantity
- if we look at commodities without looking at their use-values, their only common property is that they are products of labour - these are abstractly their values
  - labour can be measured by duration
  - different people can take different amounts of time to do the same labour
  - we can standardize by measuring **socially necessary labour time**
    - labour time necessary "to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time"
- socially necessary labour time can change
  - average skill of workers
  - science
  - engineering
  - social organization of production
  - physical conditions
- things can have 0 value
  - use-value but no value
    - things that are useful but not produced by labour
      - air
    - things that are useful but not commodities
      - things that are not exchanged in order to be used
  - things that are useless
