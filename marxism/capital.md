## Part one: Commodities and money

### 1. Commodities

#### The two factors of a commodity: Use-value and value (the substance of value and the magnitude of value)

A **commodity** is an object that satisfies a want

> To discover the various uses of things is the work of history.

- **use-value** is how useful something is as an object
  - use-values cannot exist abstractly, they are limited by physical properties of commodities, so commodities *are* use-values in material form
  - use-value is independent of how much labour it takes to use it
    - (<u>I think</u> this means that e.g. the extensive process required to make Niqiu edible does not affect the use-value of Niqiu, the use-value of Niqiu is determined only by the fact that we want to eat it)
  - a use-value is only realized when the object is used or consumed
  - they are the "material depositories of exchange value"
- **exchange value** is "the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort"
  - commodities have many exchange values - one for each commodity they could be exchanged with
  - "exchange value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it"
  - not the same as real prices!
- different commodities have use-values of different qualities, but their exchange values only differ in quantity
- if we look at commodities without looking at their use-values, their only common property is that they are products of labour - these are abstractly their values
  - labour can be measured by duration
  - different people can take different amounts of time to do the same labour
  - we can standardize by measuring **socially necessary labour time**
    - labour time necessary "to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time"
- socially necessary labour time can change depending on nature and the productiveness of labour
  - average skill of workers
  - science
  - engineering
  - social organization of production
  - physical conditions
- things can have 0 value
  - use-value but no value
    - things that are useful but not produced by labour
      - air
    - things that are useful but not commodities
      - things that are not exchanged in order to be used
  - things that are useless

#### The two-fold character of the labour embodied in commodities

- labour posseses "the same two-fold nature": useful labour (creates use-values - how and what?) and abstract labour power (determines exchange value - how much? how long a time?)
- "the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract"
  - skilled labour is nothing but intensified simple labour - it is not of a different quality
  - value is comparable between commodities when abstracting away use-values - this is analogous to  considering labour power after abstracting away different types of labour


#### The form of value, or exchange value

- it is impossible to express the value of a commodity in itself
  - "20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen" statements dreamed up by the utterly deranged
- the two poles of the expression of value are the **relative form** and the **equivalent form**
  - the value of $x$ amount of commodity A must be expressed relative to $y$ amount of commodity B
  - in this expression, the value of A is *relative* to B, and B serves only as an *equivalent* for A so its own value is not expressed
- the expression of value is not symmetric
  - in the statement ""$x$ of commodity A is worth $y$ of commodity B", A is in the relative form and B the equivalent, and the value of A is being expressed but not B
  - the symmetric statement expressing the value of B follows logically, but it is different as an expression of value
  - the equivalent is the "mode of existence of value", is "value embodied"
    - the value of A, expressed in the use-value of B, has taken the form of relative value
- quantities can be compared when they are of the same unit - $x$ linen = $y$ coat implies that linen and coat have the same unit
  - the equivalent is kind of like a unit of human labour in the abstract

#### The fetishism of commodities and the secret thereof
